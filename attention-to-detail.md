# Developing Habits to Work Faster

Over time, it's important to develop habits that can help increase your productivity. Through experience, I have learned a few habits that have made a big impact on how I work, and maybe my perspective can help you as well.

## Slow down.

No matter what task we are given, most likely, we will make mistakes. We will very rarely do something perfect the first time. Something I have learned, is if I want to move fast, I need to **slow down**.  Although that doesn't sound like the right thing to do, it has increased my productivity 10 fold.


### Practice checking your work

You should start practicing checking your own work, even when it's all in your head. Everyone makes mistakes, but to move faster through those mistakes - we need to strive to do two things -

1. Develop habits that lower the amount of mistakes we are making.
2. Develop habits that allow us to catch those mistakes more quickly.


#### Self-reviewing Pull Requests

Let's say we are working on a task - we are developing a feature for our project. We have visually studied the mockup we should folow and we have coded it at our best ability. It is working in the browser and it looks just like the design - WE DID IT!  So we commit our work and push our branch up to Github. We create a Pull Request and immediately request reviewers, and move on to our next task.

**Wait, slow down.** Personally, when I finish coding locally - I create my Pull Request and I immediately start reviewing my own Pull Request *before* I ask any reviewers to take a look. Why? Why would I review my own PR, when I just coded it and it looked great locally? I can tell you, it might seem silly, but the code that you see in your local IDE (Atom, VSCode, etc) - looks completely different than viewing the code in a pull request. It's a different perspective - you will see things you didn't see before.

I review my Pull Requests the exact same as when I review any of yours. I go line by line with a careful eye, looking for syntax errors and things that can be done better; nit-picking the same way I nit-pick for your code. I make notes, I go through and make the changes locally everytime I see something that needs changed. Then, I push back up, and view my Pull Request again. I continue until I cannot find any more errors. **Then**, I request reviewers.

The difference at this point is that now I am 100% confident in my code. I've caught those "silly" errors. Now when a reviewer comments on my code suggesting changes they could only be for one of two reasons -

1. It is something I completely didn't think of and have overlooked.
2. It is something I have yet to learn, and it becomes a learning experience.

> "It becomes a learning experience." This is the exact reason that when I review your Pull Requests, and I see something that should change - I provide the requested change as well as an indepth explanation of *why*. In case it is a learning experience, more information is provided to prevent copy/paste of suggests without understanding.

**Slow down.** Practice checking your own work, even when it’s all in your head.  Everybody makes mistakes, but you will make fewer of them if you give yourself time to process and look over things in detail.

I personally review my own PR’s several times before requesting a review. I will spend time nit-picking every part of them until I can no longer see any errors. I do this by going line through line, just as if it was your PR.

But I don’t wait until the end, I also do this as I work. I will constantly check my work making sure I’ve written the correct syntax and that things are making sense before moving on.  

This also helps when you have an error. If you’ve checked your work often, you understand parts of it better - so if an error occurs, its faster to find the error and it’s usually not because of syntax.

## Understanding Why.

**Understanding Why.** Make sure that you know the reason of why something works, or why its done a certain way. This is important to understand, so as you move further into developing your project - you can change things with knowledge rather than assumptions. 

It can be easy to google things quickly, or copy and paste something that seems to be working elsewhere. But taking a moment to look at it in a little more detail, understanding what it’s doing without assumptions, is what helps grow your knowledge in an area faster.

## Take Notes.

**Take notes.** Keeping a strong note system is key. It’s difficult to remember every fix you’ve made, every command, or every process unless it is written down and can easily be searched.

I personally write down in detail every fix I’ve made, or helped someone make. This is not wasted effort, but instead can save countless hours. I could run into the same error in the future, and I will have quick reference to provide a fix instantly.  If a better fix is discovered, I make sure to update my note as well.

I do the same for things I am just learning, even when they are very small. The more I can go back to my notes, helps me understand it better, and I can repeat it as I become comfortable with it.
