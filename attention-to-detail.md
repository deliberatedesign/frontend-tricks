# Developing Habits to Work Faster

Over time, it's important to develop habits that can help increase your productivity. Through experience, I have learned a few habits that have made a big impact on how I work, and maybe my perspective can help you as well.

## Slow down.

No matter what task we are given, most likely, we will make mistakes. We will very rarely do something perfect the first time. Something I have learned, is if I want to move fast, I need to **slow down**.  Although that doesn't sound like the right thing to do, it has increased my productivity 10 fold.


### Practice checking your work

You should start practicing checking your own work, even when it's all in your head. Everyone makes mistakes, but to move faster through those mistakes - we need to strive to do two things -

1. Develop habits that lower the amount of mistakes we are making.
2. Develop habits that allow us to catch those mistakes more quickly.

Let's say we are working on a task - we are developing a feature for our project. We have visually studied the mockup we should folow and we have coded it at our best ability. It is working in the browser, it looks just like the design - awesome!  So we commit our work and push our branch up to Github. We create a Pull Request and immediately request reviewers, and move on to our next task. We did it!

**Not quite.** When I finish my feature locally - I create my Pull Request and I immediately click on the "files" tab and view all my code changes. I give myself a code review *before* I ask any reviewers to take a look.



**Slow down.** Practice checking your own work, even when it’s all in your head.  Everybody makes mistakes, but you will make fewer of them if you give yourself time to process and look over things in detail.

I personally review my own PR’s several times before requesting a review. I will spend time nit-picking every part of them until I can no longer see any errors. I do this by going line through line, just as if it was your PR.

But I don’t wait until the end, I also do this as I work. I will constantly check my work making sure I’ve written the correct syntax and that things are making sense before moving on.  

This also helps when you have an error. If you’ve checked your work often, you understand parts of it better - so if an error occurs, its faster to find the error and it’s usually not because of syntax.

## Understanding Why.

**Understanding Why.** Make sure that you know the reason of why something works, or why its done a certain way. This is important to understand, so as you move further into developing your project - you can change things with knowledge rather than assumptions. 

It can be easy to google things quickly, or copy and paste something that seems to be working elsewhere. But taking a moment to look at it in a little more detail, understanding what it’s doing without assumptions, is what helps grow your knowledge in an area faster.

## Take Notes.

**Take notes.** Keeping a strong note system is key. It’s difficult to remember every fix you’ve made, every command, or every process unless it is written down and can easily be searched.

I personally write down in detail every fix I’ve made, or helped someone make. This is not wasted effort, but instead can save countless hours. I could run into the same error in the future, and I will have quick reference to provide a fix instantly.  If a better fix is discovered, I make sure to update my note as well.

I do the same for things I am just learning, even when they are very small. The more I can go back to my notes, helps me understand it better, and I can repeat it as I become comfortable with it.
