# Developing Habits to Work Faster

Over time, it's important to develop habits that can increase your productivity. Through experience, I have learned a few habits that have made a big impact on how I work, and perhaps you want to try out a few yourself.

## Slow down.

No matter what task we are given, most likely, we will make mistakes. We will very rarely do something perfect the first time. Something I have learned, is if I want to move fast, I need to **slow down**.  Although that doesn't sound like the right thing to do, it has increased my productivity 10 fold.


### Practice checking your own work

Practice checking your own work, even when it's all in your head. Everyone makes mistakes, but to move faster through those mistakes - we need to strive to do two things -

1. Develop habits that lower the amount of mistakes we are making.
2. Develop habits that allow us to catch those mistakes more quickly.


#### Self-reviewing Pull Requests

Let's say we are developing a feature for our project. We have visually studied the mockup we should follow and we have coded it at our best ability. It is working in the browser and it looks just like the design - WE DID IT!  So we commit our work and push our branch up to Github. We create a Pull Request and immediately request reviewers, and move on to our next task. We are so fast!

**Wait, slow down.** Personally, when I finish coding locally - I create my Pull Request and I immediately start reviewing my own Pull Request *before* I ask any reviewers to take a look. Why? Why would I review my own PR, when I just coded it and it looked great locally? I can tell you, it might seem silly, but the code that you see in your local IDE (Atom, VSCode, etc) - looks completely different than viewing the code in a pull request. It's a different perspective - you will see things you didn't see before.

I review my own pull requests the exact same as when I review any of yours. I go line by line with a careful eye, looking for syntax errors and things that can be done better; nit-picking the same way I nit-pick yours. I make notes, I go through and make the changes locally everytime I see something that needs changed. Then, I push back up, and view my Pull Request again. I continue until I cannot find any more errors. **Then**, I request reviewers.

The difference at this point is that now I am 100% confident in my code. I've caught those "silly" errors. Now when a reviewer comments on my code suggesting changes they could only be for one of two reasons -

1. It is something I completely didn't think of and have overlooked.
2. It is something I have yet to learn, and it becomes a learning experience.

> When I review your pull requests, and I see something that should change - I provide the requested change as well as an indepth explanation of *why*. In case it is a learning experience, more information is provided to help you grow.


#### Check As You Go.

While self-reviewing our own pull requests helps in learning how to check our own work - we should push it even further. I do not wait until the end to start checking my own work, but instead I check while developing.

One of the most time consuming bugs to fix is a syntax error in a project of messy, unformatted code. It literally becomes a hunt to find the needle in the haystack. You should **slow down**. As you write code, you need to constantly check your formatting and if the files have the correct tabs/spaces. It is a million times easier to tell if you are missing a closing `</div>` or a missing `}` if you are formatting as you write your code.


## Understanding Why.

Make sure that you know the reason of why something works, or why its done a certain way. This is important to understand, so as you move further into developing your project - you can change things with knowledge rather than assumptions. 

It can be easy to google things quickly, or copy and paste something that seems to be working elsewhere. But taking a moment to look at it in a little more detail, understanding what it’s doing without assumptions, is what helps grow your knowledge in an area faster.


## Take Notes.

Keeping a strong note system is key. It’s difficult to remember every fix you’ve made, every command, or every process unless it is written down and can easily be searched.

I personally take notes on every bug I've had to tackle and the fix that solved it. This is not wasted effort, but instead can save countless hours. I could run into the same error in the future, or you could, and I will have quick reference to provide a fix instantly.  If a better fix is discovered, I make sure to update my note as well.

I do the same for things for what I am just learning, even when those things are small. The more I can go back to my notes, helps me understand it better, and I can repeat it as I become comfortable with it. This also prevents me having to reach out or re-learn something because it's been a while.

We become better at our skillset with experience, so you can think of referencing your notes as an accelerator to gaining that experience. We can do this by accuratly recording the knowledge we have learned instead of having to become more familiar and re-learning each time.
